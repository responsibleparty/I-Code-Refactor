# HTML Changes
1. First I changed the title so it's something other than "website"
2. I got rid of all the div elements so that I could use semantic HTML to reduce the redundancy from using just divs. From <div class="header"> to <header> and so on.
3. I eliminated the makeshift nav bar (ul, li) and created a <nav> bar with only anchored links.
4. Changed the hero div to the banner image.
5. Changed content to <main>
6. Added a footer element.

## CSS Changes
1. Reduced all of the edits for header tag. 
2. Reduced appropriate edits for benefit section
NOTE: I tried to keep the style as close as possible to to the original site.
